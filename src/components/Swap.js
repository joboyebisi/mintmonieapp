  // TODO: Implement Swap & Withdrawal Flow
  // Based on https://github.com/pendulum-chain/spacewalk, Spacewalk is primarily a Stellar <-> Substrate bridge.
  // It allows issuing/redeeming Stellar assets (like USDC) on a Substrate chain.
  // A direct DOT -> USDC swap might not be part of the core Spacewalk bridge pallet itself.
  // Further investigation needed:
  // 1. Where does the swap occur? (Specific parachain like Pendulum? Another DEX?)
  // 2. What are the exact Polkadot.js API calls/extrinsics needed for the swap?
  // 3. How is the MoneyGram withdrawal initiated after receiving USDC?

        <li>Fetch user's DOT balance (on Relay Chain or parachain?).</li>
        <li>Get exchange rates (from where? Spacewalk bridge? A DEX?).</li>
        <li>Construct and send the swap transaction using Polkadot.js API.</li>
        <li>Handle transaction status and receiving USDC (on which chain?).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Withdrawal (MoneyGram - TBD)</strong></p>
       <ul>
        <li>Requires details on how the SpaceWalk/Pendulum ecosystem integrates with MoneyGram for withdrawals after a swap.</li>
